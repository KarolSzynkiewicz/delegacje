feat: Implement Laravel Sail for Docker setup

Replace custom Docker configuration with Laravel Sail for improved
portability and ease of use across different development environments.

Changes:
- Replace custom Dockerfile with Laravel Sail configuration
- Update docker-compose.yml to use official Sail runtime (PHP 8.3)
- Configure MySQL 8.4 as database service
- Update .env.example with Sail-compatible settings
- Add helper scripts (sail wrapper, start.sh)
- Create comprehensive Docker documentation (DOCKER_SETUP.md)
- Update README.md with Docker/Sail instructions

Benefits:
- Consistent development environment across all platforms
- Simplified setup process with ./start.sh script
- Official Laravel support and maintenance
- Better documentation and community resources
- Easier onboarding for new developers

Breaking Changes:
- Database host changed from 127.0.0.1 to 'mysql'
- Default database credentials changed (user: sail, pass: password)
- Application now runs on port 80 instead of 8000 by default

Migration Guide:
1. Backup existing .env file
2. Copy new .env.example to .env
3. Update database credentials if needed
4. Run: ./start.sh

Closes: #[issue-number]
